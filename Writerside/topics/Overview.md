# Overview of my Dear Diary

This is a reboot of my "DearDiary" project, using JetBrains WriterSide as an IDE for better organization and presentation.

The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/ker2x/DearDiary)

## What to expect ?

Security, [Reverse Engineering](Reverse-Engineering.md), [deProgramming](FAQ.md), and more.

- Some kind of informal diary
- Some kind of technical documentation
- Some kind of tutorial
- Some kind of blog
- Expect the unexpected (and the expected too)

A lot of trial & error, a lot of mistakes, a lot of fun.
I share everything, including me being an idiot jumping down the rabbit hole and chasing ghosts.
I'm not hiding my mistakes, errors, failures. Reverse Engineering is HARD so be ready to read lots of stuff going nowhere.

Including a lot of in progress, or even abandoned, entries.

## Who ?

- French guy, 45+yo, 40+ years of IT things, including programming and breaking stuff.
- I have too many microscopes (but never enough, someone send me an electron microscope please)
- An undetermined number of electronic devices, including a lot of old computers, some of them are still working.

## Why ?

huh ? Why not ?
Fame ? Money ? Boredom ? Fun ? Challenge ? All of this ?


## What now ?

I'm going to write stuff, and you're going to read it.

PS : Read the [FAQ](FAQ.md).
