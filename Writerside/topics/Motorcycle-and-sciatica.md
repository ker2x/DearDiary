Given your sciatica, a **GT (Gran Turismo)** motorcycle would be a much better option than a sportbike for the following reasons:

* **Upright Riding Position:**  A GT motorcycle offers a more upright riding posture compared to a sportbike. This reduces strain on your lower back and keeps your spine in a more neutral position, minimizing pressure on the sciatic nerve.
* **Relaxed Leg Position:**  The footpegs on a GT bike are positioned further forward than on a sportbike. This allows for a more relaxed bend in your knees, taking pressure off your lower back and hips.
* **Comfort Features:**  GT motorcycles often have features specifically designed for comfort on long rides, such as wider, well-padded seats, windscreens that deflect wind and reduce fatigue, and sometimes even cruise control. These features can significantly improve your riding experience if you have sciatica.

Sportbikes, on the other hand, have a very forward-leaning riding position that puts a lot of strain on your wrists, back, and shoulders. This can exacerbate sciatic pain.

Here's a quick summary:

| Feature                 | Sportbike          | GT (Gran Turismo)      |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Riding Position         | Leaning forward    | More upright           |
| Leg Position             | More bent           | Relaxed bend           |
| Comfort Features         | Less common         | More common (wider seats, windscreens, etc.) |
| Suitability for Sciatica | Not recommended     | Better option           |

**Additional Tips:**

* Before taking any long rides, even on a GT bike,  consult your doctor to discuss  riding and managing your sciatica.
* Take frequent breaks while riding to stretch your legs and back.
* Consider adding a backrest or lumbar support pad to your motorcycle seat for extra comfort.

Remember, prioritize your comfort and well-being when choosing a motorcycle. A GT bike with its upright riding position and comfort features can significantly improve your riding experience with sciatica.

You're right, there's a balance to be struck when considering sciatica and motorcycle riding position. Here's a breakdown of the points you mentioned:

**Upright Position and Back Strain:**

* While an overly upright position can put strain on your lower back, a **moderately upright** position offered by GT bikes can actually be beneficial for sciatica. It keeps your spine more neutral, reducing pressure on the sciatic nerve compared to a hunched-over posture.

**Forward Position and Strain Sharing:**

* Leaning forward on a sportbike may seem like it distributes stress, but it can actually compress your spine and tighten your hamstrings, both of which can worsen sciatica. The strain may also be transferred to your wrists, shoulders, and neck, leading to discomfort in those areas.

**Finding the Sweet Spot:**

The ideal position minimizes strain on your lower back while promoting good posture. Here's what a good GT riding position can offer:

* **Moderate lean:** Your torso is angled slightly forward, but not excessively hunched.
* **Relaxed arms:** Your arms should be slightly bent with minimal strain on your shoulders and wrists.
* **Neutral spine:** Your back should maintain a natural curve, avoiding slouching or excessive arching.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Adjustable handlebars:** Consider a GT bike with adjustable handlebars that allow you to customize the reach and angle for a more comfortable riding position.
* **Strengthening exercises:**  Exercises that strengthen your core and glutes can help improve your posture and support your lower back while riding.

**Remember:**

* Consult a doctor familiar with sciatica before making any riding changes.
* Test ride different GT motorcycles to find one with a seat and handlebar setup that provides the most comfortable, neutral spine position for you.

Ultimately, the best riding position depends on your individual body and sciatica severity. However, a moderately upright GT motorcycle can offer a good balance of comfort and support for your back compared to a sportbike's forward-leaning posture.
