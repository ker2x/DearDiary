# Cutting Corporate Bullshit from Corporate Documentation

Corporate documentation is often plagued with jargon, redundancy, and unnecessary complexity. Here are some strategies to streamline and clarify your documents:

## Identify and Eliminate Bullshit

* **Jargon:**
    * Replace complex terms with simpler language.
    * Define technical terms for clarity.
    * Avoid using multiple synonyms for the same concept.
* **Redundancy:**
    * Remove repeated information.
    * Condense lengthy explanations.
    * Eliminate unnecessary qualifiers (e.g., "very," "extremely").
* **Passive Voice:**
    * Convert passive voice to active voice for clarity and conciseness.
    * Example: "The report was written by the team" becomes "The team wrote the report."
* **Unnecessary Complexity:**
    * Break down complex ideas into smaller, easier-to-understand points.
    * Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize information.
    * Avoid overly long sentences.

## Focus on Clarity and Conciseness

* **Write for Your Audience:**
    * Tailor the language and level of detail to your reader's knowledge.
    * Avoid assuming prior knowledge.
* **Use Strong Verbs:**
    * Replace weak verbs with stronger ones for impact.
    * Example: "Use" instead of "utilize."
* **Be Specific:**
    * Provide concrete details and examples.
    * Avoid vague or general statements.
* **Proofread Carefully:**
    * Eliminate typos, grammatical errors, and inconsistencies.

## Practical Tips

* **Read Your Document Aloud:**
    * This helps identify awkward phrasing and unnecessary complexity.
* **Use a Style Guide:**
    * Consistent formatting and language improve readability.
* **Seek Feedback:**
    * Ask colleagues to review your document for clarity and conciseness.

## Example: Before and After

**Before:**
> "The implementation of the new system will necessitate a comprehensive evaluation of existing processes to ensure optimal utilization of resources and alignment with strategic objectives."

**After:**
> "We'll need to assess current processes to make the new system work best and fit our goals."

By following these guidelines, you can create clear, concise, and effective corporate documentation that is easy to understand and act upon.
