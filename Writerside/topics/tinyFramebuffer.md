# tinyFramebuffer

This is something I want to write since a long time. A better clone of tinyPTC.
Perhaps I'll start coding it if I add an entry here ?

All I want is a pointer to an array of pixel, and whatever I write in it is displayed on screen.
It really needs 3 functions:
- open
- update
- close

Everything else is optional. But I want to write a software renderer of course.
