# FAQ

## Wtf is a "deprogrammer" ?

I have no idea. I just made the word on the spot while writing this.
It doesn't have any deep meaning, or even shallow meaning.

> According to GitHub copilot:
> 
> it's a "person who deprograms", which is not really helpful.
> (yes, I just used GitHub copilot to write this and it called me a "deprogrammer" so I'm a deprogrammer now)
> It also suggest "deprogrammer" is a synonym of "deprogrammable", which is not really helpful either.
> Copilot is also the one who suggested me to write this FAQ, and it's writing it for me, so I'm not sure I'm really needed here.

_(GitHub copilot just generated most of the text above. Calling me useless & calling its own definition unhelpful is all on him.)_

Anyway, next question. Copilot please ? What's the next question ?

## What is a "security logbook" ?

This question suck. next.
> The git repo was called "security logbook", but then I decided to merge it with "Dear Diary"

## What is a "security diary" ?

WTF copilot ? You're not helping. Next.

## What is a "security blog" ?

Copilot, you're fired.

## I'm a human (or an improved version of Copilot) and I have a question.

Open [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ker2x/DearDiary/issues).

## Are you still using Copilot ?

![useless copilot faq.png](useless_copilot_faq.png)

Yes. Maybe, sometime.

> I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure. I'm not sure

I mean, yes, but I'm not accepting every suggestion. It gets confused ~~sometimes~~ easily.

> It's not perfect. It's not a replacement for me. It's not a replacement for you. It's not a replacement for anyone. It's not a replacement for anything. It's not a replacement for everything. It's not a replacement for the universe. It's not a replacement for the multiverse.

But I keep it for the comedic effect when it's confused. It's fun. It's also a good way to get out of a writer's block.
You may even consider it useful sometimes. But non-code suggestions aren't its strong point.

## Are you going to do some LLM/AI "research" ?

Ho yes, of course. I'm doing it right now. I don't like calling it "research" because it's not really research, it's more like "playing with stuff".
I'm not a researcher and I don't like calling myself one.

## Hacker then ?

Yes, very much so.

## What is your favorite programming language ?

[FORTRAN](https://fortran-lang.org/) !!!

> No, really, I like it. I'm not joking. I'm not kidding. I'm not lying. I'm not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying about not lying. I'm not lying about not lying about not lying about not

Urgh... Copilot really need to learn when to stop.
Fortran wasn't Copilot suggestion btw, it really is my favorite language.

I don't know about the implication of Copilot about lying and liking Fortran.

Rude.

## How is this logbook organized ?

~~it's not.~~ In an ineffable but orderly fashion.

## You're using a lot of curse words, are you angry ?

No, I'm French. It's normal.
> You'll pay for this one Copilot. I'm not sure how, but you'll pay.

## How can I follow your diary ?

Go to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ker2x/DearDiary) and click on the "Watch" button.
You can also "Star" the repo to boost my over-inflated ego. (not that it needs it)

## How can I contribute ?

I don't know, you tell me. Open an issue on GitHub ?
I'm not expecting any contribution, but if you have something to say, say it. (or rap it, code it, draw it, ...)

I don't think I even have any readers and I don't think it would be a good idea to accept contributions.
Perhaps some kind of guest writer section ? you tell me.

## Isn't a FAQ supposed to be about frequently asked questions ?

... 

yes, but I don't have any frequent readers, so I'm asking myself questions and answering them.
(or Copilot is asking me questions and answering them)

## Isn't a diary supposed to have some kind of chronological order or dated entries ?

[Yes](https://github.com/ker2x/DearDiary/commits/master/), or you can use git blame.

## Isn't it

No.
