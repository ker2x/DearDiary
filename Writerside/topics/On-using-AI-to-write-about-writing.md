# On using AI to write about writing

One thing is for sure, i'm using GitHub Copilot and it's massively helpful.
But it's kind of weird as well as it influence the way I write.

It make me write thing

![write_thing.png](write_thing.png)

But it also write things i would have written anyway. Which is even weirder.
Am i that predictable ? Or is it just that good ?

![predicatable.png](predicatable.png)

Am i predictable because i'm using it and it's influencing the way I write ?
It is, of course, "that good" and i'm not worried about this.
I'm more worried about the fact that it's influencing the way I write.

Talk about weird. [It's like a feedback loop.](Web-Enshitification.md) 
Am i enshitifying myself ?

No i'm not... i hope so. 
- i don't have to accept every suggestion.
- i can influence its suggestions by writing what i want. (and it's just completing it)

## On influencing the AI

> GitHub Copilot is a GPT-3 based AI, so it's a language model.
> It's not a "general" AI, it's a "language" AI.
> You can influence it by writing what you want it to write.
> And it will write it.

I'm gonna ask github copilot chat.

> To influence GitHub Copilot to write what you want, you can follow these steps:
>
> 1. Be explicit: Start by writing a clear and detailed comment about what you want the code to do. GitHub Copilot uses the context of your code and comments to generate suggestions.
> 
> 2. Write some code: Even if it's not complete or correct, writing some code can provide additional context to GitHub Copilot about what you're trying to achieve.
> 
> 3. Refine the suggestions: If the initial suggestion isn't what you want, you can often get different suggestions by slightly modifying your code or comments, or by accepting part of the suggestion and waiting for more.
> 
> Remember, GitHub Copilot is a tool designed to assist you. It doesn't replace your judgment or understanding of your code. You should always review and understand the code suggestions before using them.

Ha yes, sometime i forget that it's specialized in code.

Let's ask bard.ai then.

(Well, nope, i wasn't asking you copilot, but thanks for the suggestion)

> There are several ways to influence the AI so it writes what you want it to write:
> 
> * **Provide a clear and specific prompt:** The more specific your prompt, the more likely the AI is to generate the content you want. For example, instead of saying "Write a poem," you could say "Write a poem about a cat who loves to play fetch."
> * **Use keywords and examples:** Keywords and examples can help the AI understand your desired tone, style, and content. For example, if you want the AI to write a formal essay, you could include keywords like "academic," "scholarly," and "researched." If you want the AI to write a creative story, you could include examples of stories you like.
> * **Provide feedback:** After the AI generates some text, provide feedback on what you like and don't like. This will help the AI learn your preferences and improve its future responses.
> * **Use multiple prompts:** If you have a complex request, you can use multiple prompts to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, if you want the AI to write a blog post, you could use one prompt to generate an outline and another prompt to generate the main content.
> * **Be patient:** AI is still under development, so it may not always be able to generate the perfect response. Be patient and provide feedback to help the AI improve over time.
> 
> Here are some additional tips for influencing the AI:
> 
> * **Use clear and concise language:** The AI will have a harder time understanding you if your prompts are vague or ambiguous.
> * **Avoid using jargon or slang:** Jargon and slang can be confusing for the AI, so stick to standard English.
> * **Use proper grammar and syntax:** Proper grammar and syntax will help the AI understand your prompts and generate more accurate responses.
> * **Be respectful and polite:** The AI is a tool, and it should be treated with respect.
> 
> By following these tips, you can increase your chances of getting the AI to write what you want it to write.

Haaa yes, it's a chatbot meant to answer questions. So it tell me how write better question ...

Bing then ?

> There are several ways to influence AI to write what you want. Here are some tips that might help:
> 
> 1. **Understand the AI's capabilities**: AI writing tools are not perfect and have their limitations. It's important to understand what the AI can and cannot do before using it. This will help you set realistic expectations and avoid frustration.
> 
> 2. **Provide clear instructions**: The more specific and detailed your instructions are, the better the AI will be able to understand what you want. Be clear about the tone, style, and structure you want the content to have.
> 
> 3. **Use high-quality input**: The quality of the input you provide will affect the quality of the output. Make sure your input is accurate, relevant, and well-structured.
> 
> 4. **Train the AI**: Some AI writing tools allow you to train the AI to write in a specific style or tone. This can be a great way to get the AI to write exactly what you want.
> 
> 5. **Edit the output**: Even if the AI writes something close to what you want, it's important to edit the output to make sure it meets your standards. AI writing tools are not perfect and may make mistakes or produce output that is not quite right.
> 
> Remember, AI writing tools are just tools. They can be incredibly helpful, but they are not a substitute for human creativity and expertise. Use them wisely and they can help you become a better writer.

~~Haaa yes, it's a search engine. So it tell me how to search better ...~~

I'm not sure what i was expecting.

Let follow the advice of the AI and ask Copilot Chat again.

## Ask Copilot Chat to write about itself

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI. It's designed to assist developers by providing suggestions for completing lines or blocks of code. It's built on the GPT-3 model, which is a language prediction model that uses machine learning to produce human-like text.

GitHub Copilot is trained on a diverse range of public code repositories, which means it can generate code in over a dozen languages and can handle a wide variety of coding tasks. It's designed to understand the context of your code and provide relevant suggestions.

However, it's important to remember that GitHub Copilot is a tool, not a replacement for a developer. It doesn't understand code in the same way a human does. It doesn't know what your code does, it doesn't understand your intentions, and it can't make creative or strategic decisions. It simply predicts what line of code is likely to come next, based on the code it was trained on.

While GitHub Copilot can be a powerful tool for speeding up coding tasks and exploring new coding patterns, it's essential to review and understand the suggestions it provides. It's also important to remember that GitHub Copilot doesn't guarantee the correctness of the code it suggests, and it's up to the developer to ensure the code is correct, secure, and efficient.

In conclusion, GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool for developers, but like any tool, it's effectiveness depends on how it's used. It's a partner in the coding process, not a replacement for a skilled developer.

## Asking Bing chat to write about writing a diary using AI

Using the "redactor" thingy, setting : Funny, Paragraph, Medium length.

> Writing a diary using AI is a great way to keep track of your thoughts, feelings and experiences. You don't have to worry about spelling, grammar or punctuation, because the AI will take care of that for you. You can also ask the AI to generate suggestions, prompts or questions to help you write more creatively and reflectively. The AI can even add some humor and personality to your diary entries, making them more fun and engaging to read. Here's an example of a diary entry written with the help of an AI:
> 
> Dear Diary,
> 
> Today was a good day. I went to the park with my friends and we had a picnic. We played some games, took some photos and laughed a lot. The weather was nice and sunny, but not too hot. I felt happy and relaxed.
> 
> The AI suggested that I write about what I learned today, so here it goes: I learned that squirrels are very smart and sneaky. They can open zippers, unzip bags and steal food. One of them managed to get into our picnic basket and ran away with a sandwich. It was hilarious and annoying at the same time. The AI also suggested that I write a haiku about the incident, so here it is:
> 
> *Squirrel thief in park*
> 
> *Zips open our picnic bag*
> 
> *Runs away with lunch*
> 
> (Bing redactor thingy)

*"Dear Diary"* indeed.

A few things there. It's not funny and i'm not 12.

And it sucks at haiku.

## This clearly isn't going anywhere.

I didn't try Jetbrains AI Assistant. [It doesn't work in WriterSide](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WRS-3806/Add-AI-assistant).

Then, perhaps, i shouldn't worry that much about it. As soon as i filter out the suggestions that are not relevant, it's not that bad.
It is simply finishing my sentences. It's not writing for me.

## Here come Mixtral

I just heard Mixtral from [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/), it's more than free, it's open source.

So, dear AI, Write a diary on the topic of "Writing about writing with AI"

> Dear Diary,
>
> Today I am going to write about something that has become second nature to me: writing about writing with AI. It's amazing how much artificial intelligence has changed the way we create and consume content.
> 
> In the past, if someone wanted to write a piece of text, they would have to manually type each letter or word. But now, thanks to AI, we can simply tell it what we want to say and it will take care of the formatting and layout for us.
> 
> One thing I really like about using AI for writing is its ability to generate ideas. For instance, if I need a certain number of words on a specific topic, I can ask my AI assistant to come up with some suggestions. And because the technology is constantly learning from new data sources, it always has something fresh and interesting to offer.
> 
> Another benefit of using AI for writing is its ability to handle formatting and design elements automatically. If you want your text to have a certain font size, spacing or color scheme, simply mention these preferences once and the AI will apply them throughout the whole document.
> 
> However, there are also some challenges when it comes to using AI for writing. For example, the technology can sometimes struggle with understanding tone or sentiment. And if you're not precise in your instructions, it might misinterpret what you want it to do. I find that being very specific and clear about my intentions helps avoid such problems.
> 
> Additionally, there is something magical about physically writing - for example, using a pen and paper. It can be difficult to replace this feeling of creativity with just AI alone, as it makes content feel more personal and unique. However, I am confident that in the future, we will find a way to make technology work seamlessly with our own creative processes.
> 
> Thank you for letting me share my thoughts on writing about writing with AI. It's an exciting time and I look forward to seeing how this technology evolves over time.
> 
> Best,

It ran, albeit very slowly, on my cheap HP Laptop with 16GB of RAM and no GPU.
gg !

In order to run it i used [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) and the Mixtral Instruct Q2 Model ("Extreme loss of quality").
I am sincerely impressed by the quality of the text generated by this model considering it's the "Extreme loss of quality" version.

I need to try the Q4 model, as well the "Doplhin Mixtral" model which is "unfiltered" (whatever that means).
