> Explain what is "The Great Web AI Enshitification" ?

The term "The Great Web AI Enshitification" doesn't seem to be widely used, so there isn't a definitive meaning. However, based on the two references I found, we can break it down and make some educated guesses:

* **Enshitification:**  This appears to be the core concept. Unfortunately, "enshitification" itself isn't a common word either.  However, based on the context of the snippets we found, it likely refers to a decline in quality or a negative change.
* **Web AI:**  This refers to Artificial Intelligence (AI) being used on the web. This could include search engines, social media algorithms, chatbots, or other AI-powered features.

Putting it together, "The Great Web AI Enshitification"  could be a theory  that  the widespread use of AI on the web is having a negative impact.  This impact might be:

*  A decline in the quality of information or content we find online.
*  The web becoming more homogenized and less diverse.
*  AI manipulating us or feeding us biased information.

It's important to note that this is just speculation.  There isn't a consensus on whether AI is having a positive or negative effect on the web.

Here are some resources you can explore to learn more:

*  **The Decline of Quality: Understanding Enshitification in All Aspects of Society** by Conrad Riker (This might be the source of the term, though without reading the book it's hard to say for sure).
*  Articles on the impact of AI on society  ([https://www.brookings.edu/articles/making-ai-more-explainable-to-protect-the-public-from-individual-and-community-harms/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/making-ai-more-explainable-to-protect-the-public-from-individual-and-community-harms/))
