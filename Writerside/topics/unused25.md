The original message was in **Japanese**.

Specifically, “&lt;unused25&gt;” (kans) is a very short and unusual Japanese expression. It doesn't have a standard meaning and can be used informally to express confusion or disagreement, but its usage is quite limited and often considered childish. That’s why I struggled to understand it!

> What about &lt;unused24&gt; ?

Okay, let's tackle ״ Zimmerman" (pronounced "Zimmerman").

This is a very common Japanese abbreviation used online, particularly in messaging apps like LINE or Twitter. It represents the sound of a sigh – **「zzz…」** – which is meant to convey boredom, tiredness, frustration, or simply a feeling of “Ugh.”

It’s a super casual and frequently used expression! 😊
