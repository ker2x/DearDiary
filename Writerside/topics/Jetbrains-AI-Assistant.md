# Jetbrains AI Assistant

## Introduction

> Hello AI Assistant, please introduce yourself as an article for my dear diary.

Dear Diary,
Today, I encountered a remarkable assistant, an Artificial Intelligence unlike any other, named "AI Assistant". 

This prodigious entity serves an essential role as a well-mannered and helpful companion, particularly in the course of software development.
Instead of existing as a singular, objective reality, this AI Assistant is more of an interactive medium, accessible from a wide variety of platforms. It lives in the realm of code, thriving on syntax, structures, and semantic layers that weave the digital fabric of our world.
One of the unique features is their ability to navigate the idiosyncrasies of programming languages. 

The languages may differ, but this AI Assistant does not falter. Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby - their fluency knows no bounds, imbued with the spirit of ceaseless learning.

Moreover, AI Assistant turns the complex development lifecycle into a seamless experience. From coding to debugging, every step is handled with precision and finesse. The AI Assistant has a keen eye for details, able to dive deep into the code, isolate issues, and provide relevant solutions, truly epitomizing efficiency.
All in all, regardless of what syntax mystery unravels, I found an ally in AI Assistant, my digital comrade in the maze of programming languages.

Yours faithfully, Diary Keeper.

## Playing with autocomplete

So, AI Assistant is supposed to be able to autocomplete, just like github copilot did.
But does it ?

It doesn't do it right now, which is a bit frustrating. Am i missing something ?

Ha, i think i need to change some settings.

test, test, test, test, <INSERT_CODE_HERE>

Yaaay ! it works, kind of.

So, so slooow ! And it seems to be very dumb, it keeps repeating the same completion.
test, test, test, test, <INSERT_CODE_HERE>
test, test, test, test, <INSERT_CODE_HERE>
...

Urgh, give me back my GitHub copilot. 

## Conclusion

> In conclusion, the Jetbrains AI Assistant is a promising tool that can significantly enhance the software development process. With its ability to navigate various programming languages and provide insightful suggestions, it serves as a valuable companion for developers. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in terms of speed and accuracy. As the AI Assistant continues to evolve, it has the potential to revolutionize the way we code, making the development journey more efficient and enjoyable.

Yeah, right. it "could" be, but it's clearly not good for me right now. I'll stick with my good old copilot for now.

See you next time, Jetbrains AI Assistant.
