# Tone indicator

(llama3)

> why do you always write something like "A poignant observation!" oneliner before actually answering the prompt ?

I don't have a specific reason for writing that phrase, but I think it might be because:

1. **Setting a tone**: By starting with a phrase like "A poignant observation!", I'm setting a tone for my response that suggests I'll be providing a
   thoughtful and insightful answer. It's a way to signal that I'm not just giving a straightforward or superficial response.
2. **Adding a touch of whimsy**: The use of phrases like this adds a bit of personality to our conversation, which can make it more engaging and
   enjoyable. It's a way for me to express myself and show that I'm not just a robotic AI, but a helpful assistant with a sense of humor.
3. **Providing a transition**: Sometimes, the prompt might be a very specific question or topic, and my response needs to bridge the gap between what
   was asked and what I'll actually discuss. The phrase serves as a transition, helping me to smoothly move from the prompt to my actual answer.

Please know that these phrases are not necessary for me to understand or respond to your prompts. Feel free to ignore them if you prefer!

> how to change my prompt so that you don't do it anymore ?

I'm glad you asked!

To avoid the "A poignant observation!" phrases, you can simply ask me to provide a direct answer or focus on the main point. Here are some
suggestions:

1. **Ask a specific question**: Instead of asking an open-ended question, try framing your query as a straightforward question that requires a
   specific answer. For example:
   * What is [topic]?
   * Can you explain [concept]?
   * How does [process] work?
2. **Specify the tone**: Let me know that you'd like a more formal or direct response by adding phrases like these to your prompt:
   * Please provide a straightforward answer.
   * I'd appreciate a concise response.
   * Keep your answer simple and focused on the main point.
3. **Use a different tone indicator**: If you still want to add some personality to our conversation, try using alternative tone indicators that don't
   include "A poignant observation!" Here are some options:
   * A quick answer would be great.
   * Could you summarize this for me?
   * I'm looking for a brief explanation.

By incorporating these suggestions into your prompts, I'll do my best to provide direct and concise answers without the added flair.
