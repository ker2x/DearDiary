# New version of AI assistant

Looks like Jetbrains introduced a new model: [Mellum](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2024/10/22/introducing-mellum-jetbrains-new-llm-built-for-developers/)

I don't even know how to trigger autocompletion. Is it for code only ?
Do i have to use the impossible shortcut on an AZERTY mac keyboard ?

errr... test. test.

I can't find it. Frustrating !

I give up for now.
