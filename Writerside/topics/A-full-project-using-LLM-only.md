# A full project using LLM only

I don't know anything useful about HTML/CSS/JS/React/Node/Express/GraphQL/REST/... but I know how to use LLM to generate code.
So i'll make a webapp using LLM only and see how far i can go.

I'll use Jetbrain Webstorm, with the Github Copilot & AI Assistant plugin.
Wish me luck ?

- Most of the text here will be the result of the AI Assistant, with some comments and explanations from me.
- 100% of the code will be generated by the AI Assistant.

## Selecting a framework

Webstorm have the following project templates:
- Angular CLI
- Bootstrap
- Express
- HTML5 Boilerplate
- Next.js
- Node.js
- React
- React Native
- Vite
- Vue.js

I'll ask Bard what i should use.

...

Well, i'll just use HTML5 Boilerplate. It has things, and stuff. Aaaaand, I'm already lost.
Should i start with an empty project ? Yes. 

## What now ?

Ask JetBrains AI Assistant.

To start creating an HTML5 Canvas WebApp, follow these steps:

1. Create HTML file: First, you need to create an HTML file which will serve as the entry point to your application. 
_Right-click on the project explorer, select New -> HTML file, give it a name, and press Enter._

2. Add canvas element in HTML file: Add a `<canvas>` element to your HTML file. The canvas element is a container for graphics, where you can draw graphics via JavaScript.
```html 
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="480" height="320"></canvas>
```

3. Create JavaScript file: Create a new JavaScript file where we will add our code for the Canvas.
_Like before, right-click on the project explorer, select New -> JavaScript file, give it a name, and press Enter._

4. Draw on canvas: In your JavaScript file, you can obtain a reference to the canvas and then draw on it. Here is some example code that draws a rectangle:
```Javascript 
let canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas'); let ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); ctx.fillStyle = "#FF0000"; ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 150, 75);
```
Link JavaScript file in HTML file: Don't forget to include the JavaScript file into the HTML file: `<script src="your_filename.js"></script> `
 
5. Run Your Project: Right click on your HTML file in the project explorer and click "Open in Browser" to see your canvas in action.
You can expand on the above steps to include more features for your specific WebApp. You might want to add event listeners for user interactions, or create game logic if you're planning to develop a canvas-based game.
Remember to frequently save your work and make sure to commit your changes in your version control system to keep track of your project's progression.

## index.html

Well i guess i should have written a better prompt. But ok, i created a default index.html.

> **Me**
> 
> Create an index.html with a fullscreen canvas

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Fullscreen Canvas</title>
    <style>
        * {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }

        #myCanvas {
            position: absolute;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
    <script>
        const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
        canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
        canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Here is how it works** :
- The canvas is positioned absolutely, and it spans the full width and height of the page with CSS width and height set to 100%.
- The script tag at the end of the body is setting the canvas width and height to match the window's innerWidth and innerHeight. This makes the canvas truly full screen.

_Well, it looks like it works_

## Refactoring

Following the initial instructions, I created an empty main.js file.
But first, let's as AI assistant to suggest refactoring. Here is the result:

**index.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Fullscreen Canvas</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
<script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**style.css**
```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
#myCanvas {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```

**app.js**
```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
```

## Customizing AI Assistant

- There is a conflict between AI Assistant and Copilot for auto-completion.

> Disabling copilot in the plugins menu so that AI Assistant can take over. (I keep it in WriterSide however)

- I didn't ask for documentation, therefore i didn't get documentation. But we can create custom AI actions to add documentation to the code.

> _Alt-enter -> AI Actions -> Add your prompts : `Add documentation to $SELECTION`_

Done. And it works :
```Javascript
// Fetch the HTML canvas by its Id 'myCanvas'
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
// Set the canvas width to match the window's inner width
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
// Set the canvas height to match the window's inner height
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
```

```CSS
/* 
 * Reset rule: 
 * Applies to every element. It resets the margin and padding to 0 
 * to remove the browser's default styling.
 */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

/*
 * #myCanvas rule:
 * Applies to the element with id "myCanvas". 
 * This element is set to an absolute position, 
 * and having 100% width and height makes it occupy the full viewport.
 */
#myCanvas {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```

### Reset rule ?

WTH is a reset rule ? I'll ask for more information.

A CSS reset rule is used to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins, and font sizes of headings, etc. It involves setting the styles that you want to have as the defaults in every browser, thus setting a level playing field for all of your styles moving forward.
In your provided CSS snippet, this line of code:
```CSS
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```
It is indeed a CSS Reset rule. It targets all (*) elements and sets their margin and padding properties to 0, removing the default space that browsers apply to these properties for most elements. It's a way to maintain unified styles across different browsers and ensure your design looks consistent. The * selector in CSS is used to select all elements.

## Make it square

I asked AI Assistant to make the canvas square. Here is the result:

```Javascript
// Fetch the HTML canvas by its ID 'myCanvas'
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');

// Get the smaller dimension between the window's inner width and height
const minDimension = Math.min(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

// Set the canvas width and height to match the smaller dimension
canvas.width = minDimension;
canvas.height = minDimension;
```

But there is a problem, the canvas does not stay square. I'll ask for help.

> **Me**
> 
> The canvas doesn't stay square, what should i do ?

This happens because the size of the canvas is only set when the page initially loads, not when the window is resized. To keep the canvas square even when the window is resized, you can add an event listener for the window's resize event, and update the canvas dimensions in the event handler. Here's how you can modify your code to do this:

```Javascript
// Fetch the HTML canvas by its ID 'myCanvas'
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');

// Function to update canvas dimensions
function updateCanvasDimension() {
    // Get the smaller dimension between the window's inner width and height
    const minDimension = Math.min(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

    // Set the canvas width and height to match the smaller dimension
    canvas.width = minDimension;
    canvas.height = minDimension;
}

// Update canvas dimensions initially
updateCanvasDimension();

// Add an event listener for the resize event
window.addEventListener('resize', updateCanvasDimension);
```

> **Me**
> 
> It still doesn't appear to be square

(I'll cut the explanation)

```CSS
#myCanvas {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
}
```

Now it works. I asked AI to suggest refactoring and find problem. It's mostly about responsive design, but i don't care.

### However

it look like a canvas have an internal size and a display size.
I'd like to have the internal size to a fixed known value.

> **AI Assistant**
> 
> Yes, a HTML canvas element has two sizes: the size of the drawing surface (internal size) and the size at which it is displayed (CSS size or display size).

> **Me**
> 
> Refactor this code so that the internal width and height have a fixed size of 1024 and never change.

```Javascript
// Fetch the HTML canvas by its ID 'myCanvas'
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
// Set the canvas width and height to fixed size of 1024
canvas.width = 1024;
canvas.height = 1024;
// Get the context of the canvas
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
// Set the canvas background to black
context.fillStyle = 'black';
context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

## Refactoring again and setting up the structure of the application

I'll spare the back and forth with AI Assistant, here is where i am so far.
I didn't write a single line of code, i asked AI Assistant "refactor" stuff, "rewrite" things, and it did.

**app.js**
```Javascript
// Constants definition
const CANVAS_SIZE = 1024;
const UPDATE_INTERVAL = 1000;

let canvas;
let context;

// Define setup function
function setup() {
    // Fetch the HTML canvas by its id 'myCanvas'
    canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
    if (!canvas) {
        console.error("Unable to find canvas");
        return;
    }
    // Get the context of the canvas
    context = canvas.getContext('2d');
    if (!context) {
        console.error("Unable to get canvas context");
        return;
    }
    setupCanvas(canvas, context);
    // Register your keydown callback
    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeydown);
    // Register your mouse event callback
    window.addEventListener('click', handleMouseEvent);
    console.log('Setup function called');
}

function setupCanvas(canvas, context) {
    // Set the canvas width and height to predefined size
    canvas.width = CANVAS_SIZE;
    canvas.height = CANVAS_SIZE;
    // Set the canvas background to black
    context.fillStyle = 'black';
    context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
}

// Define update function
function update() {
    // Put your update logic here
    console.log('Update function called');
}

// Define draw function
function draw() {
    // Put your draw logic here
    console.log('Draw function called');
    // Call requestAnimationFrame again to get smooth animation
    requestAnimationFrame(draw);
}

// Replace keypress with keydown callback
function handleKeydown(event) {
    console.log('Keydown event: ', event.key);
}

// Define your mouse event callback
function handleMouseEvent(event) {
    console.log('Mouse event: ', event.type);
}

// Call setup function
setup();

// Call update function every 'interval' milliseconds
setInterval(update, UPDATE_INTERVAL);

// Call draw function at each animation frame
requestAnimationFrame(draw);
```
